	<h3>Advice On Creating A Pitch</h3>
	<p>Write the pitch so that anyone who reads it will want to see that story materialize. Sell your idea and your expertise on the subject. Don’t be afraid to be personal.</p>
	<p>Upload a YouTube or Vimeo video explaining who you are and why you’re the right person for the job. Imagine what civic leaders or organizations would want to partner with you.</p>
	<p>Remember - the public now has a freelance budget, pitch them like you would the editor of a major metropolitan newspaper. <a href="http://blog.spot.us/2008/10/09/independent-journalists-how-to-raise-your-own-income" target="blank" title="Learn more about creating a pitch">read more &rarr;</a></p>
	<h3>What If My Pitch Doesn’t Reach its Goal?</h3>
	<p>You can accept to do the pitch regardless of whether or not you reach the original goal. So, if you raise 80% of the stated goal, you can still accept that money, but you must do what was outlined in the original pitch. You can also choose to cancel the pitch at any time and donations will be directed back to the original donors in the form of credits so they may direct it to another pitch.</p>
		<p>In the future we will have a more dynamic credit card system that will only charge a users credit cards upon the succesful acceptance of a pitch.</p>
