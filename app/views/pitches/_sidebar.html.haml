  %h3 Common Questions

  %h4.title What's a Tip?
  %p.alt-spotus 
    Anyone can create a news "tip" about an important topic you think should
    be reported on? This is often related to the question "what are you
    passionate about?" You can pledge to this tip, but no money is taken -
    it's just a way to show how much interest you have in this possibly
    becoming a pitch (link to pitch Faq). Creating a tip could be the spark
    that starts an investigation.

  %h4.title What do you mean "Pledge?"
  %br/ 
  %p.alt-spotus 
    Pledges do not represent an actual money transaction. But, they do show
    the general monetary value that a story might command. When you "pledge"
    a tip, it's similar to joining a group. If a journalist references this
    tip in their pitch, you'll be notified and asked to DONATE real money at
    that point.
