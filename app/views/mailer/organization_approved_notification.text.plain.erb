Welcome to Spot.Us and thanks for joining our effort to produce community 
funded investigative journalism.

We apologies for the slight delay in approving your account. 
News Organizations are the ONLY type of account that we grant special 
privileges to and as a result we are very careful about who is given a 
“news organization” account on spot.us

You now have a password here it is: <%= @user.password %>
Please login and change this password right away. It is a one-time 
only password.

If you have any questions – don’t hesitate to contact 
David Cohn: David@spot.us

In the meantime – here are some ideas on how to get started.

1. Start a tip: This lets other freelance reporters know what you want covered. 
2. Fund a pitch: Perhaps a freelance reporter has already created a pitch 
that would be of interest to you. Your donation could turn it into a reality.
Check out our browse feature here: http://spot.us/browse

As a news organization you are NOT limited in how much you can donate towards
a pitch. This is because you have been vetted to follow the code of 
journalistic ethics as described by the Society of Professional Journalists.

If you donate 50% or more towards a pitch, Spot.Us will grant you temporary 
exclusive rights to the content.

Or: You can donate 100% towards a pitch and spot.us will grant you temporary 
exclusive rights to the content and reimburse any community members that had 
pre-funded the pitch. This is a way to build a new relationship with your 
readers. Trust us, they’ll love you for refunding their donation.

We are very hands on and passionate about making sure that the information 
needs of our communities are met. We work for you!!!!

Sincerely,
David Cohn
