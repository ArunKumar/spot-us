  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>A Spot.Us sponsorship guarantees an extended brand experience for the audience in an uncluttered and controlled environment. Audiences spend approximately three minutes exposed to the brand with no other advertising on the page. They'll engage with the brand on our terms and once the transaction is completed they'll support the reporting project of their choice thanks to you, leaving them with powerful positive association with your brand. <a href="#">Download the sponsorship kit for more</a>.</p>
