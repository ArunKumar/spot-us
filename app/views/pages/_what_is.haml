      What is a Tip?
  %hr/
  %p
    Anyone can create a news "tip" about an important topic you think should be reported on. This is
    often related to the question "what are you passionate about?" You can pledge to this tip, but
    no money is taken - it’s just a way to show how much interest you have in this possibly becoming
    a pitch. Creating a tip could be the spark that starts an investigation.
    
  %a{:name => "pledge_versus_tip"}
    %h2 What's the difference between Pledge and Donate?
  %hr/
  %p
    Pledges give reporters a sense of community interest in a news &ldquo;tip.&rdquo; It does not
    represent real money. Nothing is committed - although we ask you pledge only what you’d be
    willing to eventually donate if a reporter builds a full "pitch" inspired by this tip. Donations
    to pitches are tax-deductable and are a transaction. If the pitch is unsuccesful, you will
    receive money back in the form of Spot.Us credits. No matter what your money will go to support
    journalism. In the future we hope to build out a more dynamic credit system such that credit
    cards are only charged if the specific pitch you want has reached its funding goal.
        
  %a{:name => "donation_goal"}
    %h2 What if the pitch I donate to doesn't reach it's goal?
  %hr/
  %p
    All credits are returned to your account and you can direct them towards any other existing
    pitch. You will have until the end of the fiscal year to put the money back in circulation
    through the Spot.Us system.

  %h2 What is a Tip?
  %hr/
  %p
    Tips are exactly what they sound like – community tips on untold and important stories. 
    Creating a pitch and then referencing a tip will send a note to every member of that group 
    to let them know their story tip could become a reality in your pitch. In this sense - the 
    community is your ally in forming pitches. Browse the tips and create pitches based on them. 
    You can reference as many tips as are relevant to your pitch.

    %h2 Advice on Creating a Pitch
  %hr/
  %p
    Write the pitch so that anyone who reads it will want to see that story materialize. Sell your
    idea and your expertise on the subject. Don’t be afraid to be personal. Upload a You Tube video
    explaining who you are and why you’re the right person for the job. Imagine what civic leaders
    or organizations would want to partner with you. Remember - the public now has a freelance
    budget, pitch them like you would the editor of a major metropolitan newspaper.

  %a{:name => "tip_attach"}
    %h2 Attaching a Tip to Your Pitch
  %hr/
  %p
    Attaching a tip is a reporters way of tapping the community members on the shoulder and saying
    “hey, I’ve referenced your news tip in my pitch.” You can ping as many tips as you want – but
    they should be related to the pitch you create.
    
  %a{:name => "qa_editor"}
    %h2 What’s the role of the Fact-Check Editor?
  %hr/
  %p
    The Fact-Check editor has two main responsibilities – to fact-check the reporting and ensure
    fairness. To do the later the QA editor should be in touch with the journalist before reporting
    begins and before the draft is uploaded. At any time the Fact-Check editor can report suspicious
    activities to Spot.Us. Fact-Check editors are assigned by spot.Us, and the reporter can reject
    the first two assigned editors. The investigation will not publish without the Fact-Check
    editor's approval. Any journalist can apply to be a Fact-Check editor within their profile.
    
  %a{:name => "pitch_goal"}
    %h2 What if my pitch doesn’t reach it’s goal?
  %hr/
  %p
    You can accept to do the pitch regardless of whether or not you reach the original goal. So, if
    you raise 80% of the stated goal, you can still accept that money, but you must do the same
    amount of work original stated in the pitch. You can also choose to cancel the pitch at any time
    and donations will be directed back to the original donors so they may direct it to another
    pitch.

    We will not share this information with anyone, it’s merely so we can send you a check for the

  %a{:name => "creative_commons"}
    %h2 What’s the Creative Commons Deal?
  %hr/
  %p
    Journalism is a process - not a product. The end content produced by Spot.Us will be given away
    for free unless a news organization has either contributed between 50 or 100% of the total cost.
    In that situation - we will grant that news organization temporary rights to the article.

  Changing a Pledge. You can change a pledge or donation at any time. For a tip, just find the
  pledge in your dashboard and make the change. For a donation, if you increase the donation you’ll
  have to “checkout” again – if you lower your donation, you’ll have spare credits which you can
  direct to a different pitch (spreading the love).
  
  Why Credits? Spot Credits are yours and they will remain in your control until a pitch of your
  choosing reaches its fundraising goal. All of the money you donate will go to the reporting needed
  to finish an investigation – Spot.Us asks for tips to the organization, but it is not required and
  we are transparent in asking for tips. In the future we will be looking into options outside of
  credits to pay for investigative reporting – but for this version, it is the best way to get the
  job done.
  
  Why Tell a Friend? Spot.Us is about giving groups a new sense of editorial power. The only way an
  investigation gets funded is if a group or network sees value in it. If you are a civic-leader,
  you can take ownership of a tip or pitch by spreading word about it and making it a reality.
  
  What’s an RSS feed? RSS stands for Really Simple Syndication. That means instead of you having to
  visit spot.us to find out what is new – we will send updates directly to your RSS reader. If
  you’re brand new to RSS, try Google Reader, it’s simple to use. Get your Google Reader up and
  running – then come back and click this funny orange button. FAQ for Reporters
  
  What’s a Reporters Notebook? A reporters notebook allows the QA editor and reporter to converse.
  It also allows a reporter to upload any reporting they’ve done while working on the larger
  investigation. The reporter can make this reporting public or private, but Spot.Us encourages
  transparency at all levels.
  
  Why give extra to spot.us? (also for Right coloumn of Profile View) Spot.Us is an exciting
  nonprofit project to pioneer “community funded reporting.” We believe journalism is a process –
  not a product and all we want to do is support good local investigative journalism. While we do
  everything to keep our overhead low, just accepting donations means we are running at a loss.
  Credit card companies take a small percentage of every transaction. We are trying to cover that
  cost ourselves but as a small nonprofit, we hope you will help us keep the lights on with a small
  donation that goes to the organization to recoup this loss.

  Ways we can get exclusive content 1. Donate up to 50 percent of the value of an investigation.
  This is only available until the investigation has reached 51 percent funding through community
  donations (so get in the game early). 2. Donate 100 percent of the value of an investigation. You
  can do this at any time – all proceeds will be given back to community members to invest in
  another pitch, so in a way you get two investigations for the price of one. 3. You can always run
  our content for free, unless another news organization has done steps one or two above. 4. We
  encourage you to donate small amounts as well. Even a tiny donations from a news organization can
  be the push to get a pitch the momentum it needs to get community funding – and you are welcome to
  the final content or even to apply as a fact-check editor.
