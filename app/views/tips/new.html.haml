    %h4.title What's a Tip?
    %p.alt-spotus 
      Anyone can create a news "tip" about an important topic you think should
      be reported on? This is often related to the question "what are you
      passionate about?" You can pledge to this tip, but no money is taken -
      it's just a way to show how much interest you have in this possibly
      becoming a pitch (link to pitch Faq). Creating a tip could be the spark
      that starts an investigation.

    %h4.title What do you mean "Pledge?"
    %br/ 
    %p.alt-spotus 
      Pledges do not represent an actual money transaction. But, they do show
      the general monetary value that a story might command. When you "pledge"
      a tip, it's similar to joining a group. If a journalist references this
      tip in their pitch, you'll be notified and asked to DONATE real money at
      that point.
